The Orig files were created prior to code changes in GUtilityFuncts and elsewhere.  Following changes, run the code with the photon.cph testfile.  Use the configuration and pilot files in this directory in the Config subdirectory.  Then, compare the root files with the "orig" root files, either looking at the cherenkov image or individual photons.  I'll write root scripts to do this based on a root tutorial.  More about this later.
