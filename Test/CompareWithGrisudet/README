Sorry for the confusion here... BUT

DO NOT USE the makePhotonsOffset.cpp code in GrISU/Simulations/Make_Photons
to create a test file for use by both GrOptics and GrISU.

Instead use the pilot file in this directory with the GrOptics/Make_Photons
makePhotonsOffset.cpp code. 

The code in the GrOptics package uses GrOptics classes which
of course are not available in the GrISU package.

File Descriptions

detector.pilot:  the usual grisudet pilot file 

veritasGrISUforGrOpticsCompare_oneTel_mirrorParmsZero.cfg :GrISU telescope
cfg file with mirror mis-align and blur radius parameters set to zero.
Reflection coefficients are 1.0. 

veritasGrISUforGrOpticsCompare_oneTel.cfg : GrISU telescope cfg file with
mirror misalign and blur radius parameters at usual values.  Reflection
coefficients are 1.0

veritasCompareGrOptics.cfg:  GrOptics veritas cfg file
This file is not useful in these comparison studies.

veritasCompareGrOptics_nonzeroFacetParms.cfg
This file has the same facet misalign/blur parameters as the GrISU
veritas cfg files in this folder. You can change the reflection
coefficients and the shadowing option as needed (see the TELSTD
record in this file 

veritasCompareGrOptics_zeroedFacetParms.cfg
Same as the above file, but with misalign/blur parameters set to
zero.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Outline of comparison
1. GrISU:   'cvs checkout -r version-6-2-0-beta-branch'
   GrOptics: 'git clone https://github.com/groptics/GrOptics'
   	     'git checkout DCFacetP' (until I merge to the master branch)

2. Produce the veritasStarOffset.cph file in GrOptics/Make_Photons.

3. Use this or similar photon files for your coparisons.

4. With unsynchronized random number generators between grisudet and GrOptics, it's
best to have the facet misalign and blur parameters set to zero and all reflection
coefficients set to 1.0.  And, start with shadowing turned off.

Then, use the photon_history files in a root tree browser to
make comparisons of photons on the facets and on the camera plane.

You can use tree->Scan(list of tree branches, and cuts, etc.) to follow
individual photons through the telescope.

If shadowing is turned on, you will not be able to follow individual photons. In
grisudet, only those photons that produce a photoelectron are tested for shadowing
(thus leading to a faster execution speed). In GrOptics all photons are tested as
they pass through the telescope. But, if you know what you are doing, you can add a
one of two lines of code that sets a flag indicating photoelectron production and
sets the pmt hit number to e.g. 100.
