GrOptics is a ray-tracing package for telescope arrays containing a combination of 
Davis-Cotton (DC) and Schwarzschild-Couder (SC) optical systems.  The DC telescope 
class models a standard Veritas telescope using a grisudet configuration file. The SC
class models an ideal SC telescope. For version 1.0, the SC telescope shape 
parameters are hard coded in the GSCTelescope class. 

GrOptics accepts input from GrISU compatible photon files.

1. Version History

       version 1.0 (v1.0)
       svn revision number: r1353

       version 2.0 (will update files to "v2.0" soon)
       svn revision number 1553  USE THIS SVN VERSION, -r1509
          see new testtel option in opticsConfiguration.pilot file

       version 2.1:  svn revision number: r1646  
       added rotation and translation error offsets for all elements of 
       an SCTelescope by containing the secondary mirror and the
       camera/focal surface in individual geovolumes and then using
       rotation and translation transformations to position these
       volumes in the top volume. This might increase the execution
       time a bit, but we need the error offsets. A later version will
       provide mirror roughness reflection. 
       Revised SC camera parameters to conform
       with Nepomuk's camera description; documentation in 
       stdSCTelescope.cfg configuration file.  Substantially 
       cleaned up the code, more to do however. Now using
       robast v1.4.3.

       current working version is: r1662 or later. use this for
       mirror roughness and robast v1.5.0_beta. Code won't compile
       until AOpticsManager.h is updated in robast - that should 
       occur today or tonight: March 8 2012

1. Installation

   Dependencies: ROOT, Gsl, robast	
   Check out current version from svn repository

   repository name = 
   svn+ssh://svn.slac.stanford.edu/nfs/slac/g/agis/repo/subversion/trunk/simulation/GrOptics

   <prompt> svn co <repository name> -r1553
   <prompt> cd GrOptics
   <prompt> make

   The Makefile will download the robast package from sourceforge and compile its libraries. 
   These libraries and the source code will be in the GrOptics/v1.4.3 directory.  The robast package, 
   written and maintained by Akiri Okumura, contains the ROOT geometry add-on classes used 
   to construct the SC telescopes. For more details go http://sourceforge.net/projects/robast/ 
   and to http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.4448.
   
   The executable is grOptics

   to see command line arguments
   <prompt> grOptics -help

2. Tests

   All files to test the grOptics code are included in the tarball.  The tests use the 
   Config/photon.cph photon file containing a single 0.8 TeV shower. The test telescope
   array is defined in Config/arrayConfig.cfg as 3 veritas-type telescopes and a single 
   SC telescope, all located in a square array. The veritas4Tel.cfg file contains a standard
   veritas configuration file plus additional records needed by GrOptics at the head of this
   file.

3. Documentation

   See the GrOptics/README/ files. Each configuration file in GrOptics/Config is fully 
   documented.

   Expect fairly frequent updates. The next version will read the SC telescope parameters from
   the SC telescope input file. Currently, these parameters are hard coded in GSCTelescope.cpp.

4. Comments

   If you do not have access to the Stanford svn repository, let me know and I'll place the 
   tarball in a Grinnell public directory at a mutually convenient time for downloading.
